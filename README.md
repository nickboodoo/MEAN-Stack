How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
Writing programs that are maintainable, readable and adaptable means writing simple, modular, and reusable code that has a clear purpose to a reader. Classes and methods should be made intentionally. The code should be straightforward and easy to follow. Good code, such as the code that we made for the CRUD Python module needs to be very adaptable so that it can be applied to different tasks readily.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, it is important to understand waht you are working with. First you need to understand the needs of the client and then build a program around those needs. You need to be able to build code that serves a purpose. In this class we had very clear goals that we needed to accomplish.



What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Working on this project has really put into perspective all of the work required to plan, build and execute writing a program. This was a full stack development that was a very important project to learn because it gave me very valuable real world experience. Working on projects like this will prepare me for professional computer scientist work.
